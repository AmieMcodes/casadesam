## About This Project

Casa de SAM is a long-horizon project building toward the creation of a **permanent, dignified home in Paraguay for adults with lifelong support needs** — individuals who will never live independently and require full daily care and supervision.

This repository contains the **public-facing website** for Casa de SAM.

The site is intentionally simple, static, and calm. It is not a prototype for rapid iteration, and it is not designed to optimize for engagement, conversion, or growth metrics. Its purpose is to **hold a vision steadily over time**.

Opening is planned for **March 16, 2035**.

## The Meaning of Sãso · Alegría · Morada

These three words are the philosophical foundation of Casa de SAM and guide every design and architectural decision — including how this website is built.

### **Sãso — Calm and Safety**

Sãso represents environmental calm, predictability, and safety.

**For residents, this means:**
- low sensory load  
- consistent routines  
- environments designed to reduce stress rather than stimulate performance

**For this website, it means:**
- minimal motion  
- no flashing, looping, or attention-seeking animation  
- content that reveals gently and then stays still  
- a reading experience that does not rush or manipulate attention

Calm is treated as a form of care.

### **Alegría — Joy Without Performance**

Alegría is not entertainment, productivity, or achievement.

It is joy that is:
- optional  
- quiet  
- unmeasured  
- allowed to exist without explanation

For residents, joy grows naturally when safety and belonging are present.

**For this website, alegría appears only in subtle ways:**
- warm color accents  
- breathing room between sections  
- language that does not pressure, persuade, or sell

Joy is never demanded — it is permitted.

### **Morada — A True Home**

Morada means home in the deepest sense:
- permanence  
- belonging without expiration  
- a place where no one must become someone else in order to stay

Casa de SAM is designed so that, if they wish, residents may live in the same room for life.

Likewise, this website is built to be:
- readable years from now  
- understandable without context  
- resilient to changing web trends

Morada assumes longevity from the start.

---

## Technical Philosophy

This site is built using:
- Static HTML  
- CSS  
- Minimal vanilla JavaScript

There are no frameworks, build tools, or dependencies.

### Why a static site?

- Longevity over novelty  
- Accessibility and clarity over complexity  
- Easy auditing and maintenance  
- Low risk of breakage over time

Future enhancements (maps, video storytelling, archival content) may introduce additional tooling, but the **default posture is restraint**.

If there is ever a choice between **more motion** or **more stillness** — **stillness wins**.

---

## Motion Design

The only animation used on the site is a **one-time, gentle scroll reveal**:
- content fades in softly  
- moves upward by only a few pixels  
- respects reduced-motion accessibility settings  
- never loops  
- never disappears on scroll back up

Motion exists only to help the reader *arrive* at the text — not to draw attention to itself.

---

## Current Status

Casa de SAM is currently in a **planning and research phase**.

The project is:
- not yet a registered nonprofit  
- not accepting donations  
- not operating programs

This site exists to share the vision as it takes shape and to establish a clear, grounded foundation for future development.

---

## Long View

Casa de SAM is structured to outlast any single founder or generation of leadership.

This repository — like the project itself — is designed with a **long memory**:
- stable structure  
- clear intent  
- minimal technical debt

It is meant to be understandable not just today, but decades from now.

---

## Closing

Casa de SAM is not only for one person.

It is for every adult who deserves a life shaped by:
- calm  
- joy  
- belonging  
- and home

**Sãso. Alegría. Morada.**  
A way of living.  
A long-term promise.  
And the beginning of a story meant to last for generations.
