    <p><strong>Building a Home That Can Last for Generations</strong></p>

    <p>
      Casa de SAM is designed to protect resident care quietly and consistently — without crisis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sustainability here exists for one reason:
      <strong>permanence.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>A Different Financial Philosophy</h2>

    <p>
      Casa de SAM is intentionally not donation-dependent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Core operations are designed to be supported by predictable,
      community-integrated revenue streams so that care is never interrupted
      by fundraising cycles or economic shifts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Stability is a form of care.
    </p>

    <h2>The Bakery Network — The Primary Engine</h2>

    <p>
      A community bakery network forms the financial backbone of the project.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bakery is not the mission.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is the engine that protects the mission.
    </p>

  <section class="sam-section sam-card reveal">
    <h2>The Farm</h2>

    <p>The on-site farm supports:</p>

    <p>
      - campus food supply<br>
      - bakery ingredients<br>
      - seasonal produce sales
    </p>

    <p>
      Resident participation is always optional and never tied to productivity.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="sam-section reveal">
    <h2>Respite Care</h2>

    <p>
      Structured respite care provides relief to families while strengthening
      long-term financial stability.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="sam-section sam-card reveal">
    <h2>Carefully Designed Public Spaces</h2>

    <p>
      Select non-residential areas are open to the public during scheduled times.
    </p>

    <p>
      Public engagement supports private stability.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="sam-section reveal">
    <h2>Long-Term Agricultural Assets</h2>

    <p>
      Tree cultivation and other patient agricultural assets provide quiet,
      long-term financial buffering aligned with a 150-year vision.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="sam-section sam-callout reveal">
    <h2>Endowment Philosophy</h2>

    <p>
      Over time, Casa de SAM intends to build an endowment whose sole purpose
      is to protect resident care.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is not designed for urgency or expansion — only stability.
    </p>

    <div class="sam-divider"></div>

    <p>
      Sustainability is not about profit.<br>
      It is about protection.
