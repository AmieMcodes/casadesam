    <p><strong>A Future Home for Adults With Lifelong Support Needs</strong></p>
    <p>Paraguay • Opening March 16, 2035</p>

    <p>
      Casa de SAM is a long-horizon project: a peaceful, permanent home designed
      for adults who will never live independently — built on dignity, routine,
      safety, friendship, and joy.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not an institution.<br>
      It is not a program.<br>
      It is a home — designed to last for generations.
    </p>

  <!-- OPENING DAY -->
  <section class="sam-section sam-card reveal">
    <h2>Opening Day</h2>
    <p><strong>March 16, 2035 — 12:00 noon (Friday)</strong></p>

    <p>
      That date matters.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is the day Casa de SAM opens its doors —
      and the day my son Samuel turns eighteen.

  <!-- WHY THIS EXISTS -->
  <section class="sam-section reveal">
    <h2>Why This Exists</h2>

    <p>
      Across the world, autism is being identified more frequently.
      Some autistic people will live independently.
      Others will need lifelong care, daily support, and full-time supervision.
    </p>

    <p>
      Children grow into adults.<br>
      Parents age.<br>
      Families are left asking what comes next.
    </p>

    <p>
      Casa de SAM exists because adulthood deserves as much planning,
      dignity, and care as childhood — especially for those who will never
      live independently.
    </p>

    <p>
      Casa de SAM is not only for my son.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is for every adult who deserves a life shaped by calm,
      joy, belonging, and home.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Sãso. Alegría. Morada.</strong><br>
      A way of living.<br>
      A long-term promise.<br>
      And the beginning of a story meant to last for generations.
