    <h2>Place Matters When You’re Building a Forever Home</h2>

    <p>
      Paraguay is not a backdrop to this project.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is one of its foundations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Casa de SAM is being built here because Paraguay offers something rare and essential for adults with lifelong support needs:
      space, rhythm, warmth, and the possibility of permanence.
    </p>

    <h2>A Culture Shaped by Family and Belonging</h2>

    <p>
      Paraguayan life is deeply relational. Families live close to one another. Daily life happens outdoors.
      Neighbors know each other. Time moves differently.
    </p>

    <p>
      Care does not exist in isolation here — it exists inside family systems, community routines, and shared daily life.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project is not about importing a foreign model.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is about building with the strengths that already exist.
    </p>

  <section class="sam-section reveal">
    <h2>Climate That Supports Open-Air Living</h2>

    <p>
      Open walkways.
      Shaded patios.
      Natural light.
      Fresh air as part of daily routine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Open-air design is not an aesthetic choice.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is a care decision.
    </p>

    <h2>Land That Allows Dignity and Space</h2>

    <p>
      Casa de SAM requires 7–12 hectares not for scale — but for peace.
    </p>

    <p>Paraguay allows:</p>

    <p>
      - human-scaled residential design<br>
      - clear separation between public and private spaces<br>
      - room for farming, sensory forests, and long-term growth
    </p>

  <section class="sam-section reveal">
    <h2>A Growing, Under-Planned Reality</h2>

    <p>
      Autistic children in Paraguay are growing into adults.
    </p>

    <p>
      Families are carrying the responsibility largely on their own.
    </p>

    <p>
      Casa de SAM exists to ensure adulthood does not arrive without a plan.
    </p>

  <section class="sam-section sam-callout reveal">
    <h2>Closing</h2>

    <p>
      Paraguay is not where this project happens.
    </p>

    <p>
      Paraguay is why it can exist at all.
