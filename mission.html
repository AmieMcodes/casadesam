    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <div class="sam-divider"></div>

    <p>
      I am the mother of a son who will live a very different life from the one I imagined when he was born.
      As I came to understand his needs more clearly, one question began to weigh heavily on my heart:
    </p>

    <p><strong>Who will care for my child when I am gone?</strong></p>

    <p>
      Casa de SAM is being created for adults who require lifelong support — individuals who need full daily care
      and supervision, but not ICU-level medical intervention.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is an adult-only environment designed for peace, safety, routine, and permanence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once someone is welcomed as a long-term resident, they remain home — permanently.

    <h2>What We Are Building</h2>

    <p>
      Casa de SAM is a thoughtfully designed, multi-building campus that blends Paraguayan open-air living with
      long-term care and sustainability.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project is guided by four core areas:
    </p>

    <div class="sam-divider"></div>

    <h3>Home-Style Living</h3>
    <p>
      Small, familiar houses — not institutions — designed for lifelong residence and calm daily rhythms.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Paraguay</h3>
    <p>
      A culture rooted in family, outdoor living, and community — and a place where long-term adult care needs are rising.
    </p>

    <h3>How It Sustains Itself</h3>
    <p>
      A self-supporting model built around a working farm, a bakery network, respite care, and carefully designed
      public spaces.
    </p>

    <h3>The Long View</h3>
    <p>
      A 150-year vision focused on permanence, stewardship, and thoughtful growth — not urgency.

    <h2>Our Current Stage</h2>

    <p>
      Casa de SAM is currently in a planning and research phase.
    </p>

    <p>We are:</p>
    <p>
      - conducting legal and regulatory research in Paraguay and the United States<br>
      - evaluating land options<br>
      - developing architectural concepts<br>
      - modeling long-term sustainability<br>
      - consulting with professionals across care, construction, and operations
    </p>

    <div class="sam-divider"></div>

    <p>
      We are not yet a registered nonprofit and are not accepting donations.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site exists to share the vision as it takes shape.

    <h2>Closing</h2>

    <p>
      Casa de SAM is not only for my son.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is for every adult who deserves a life shaped by calm, joy, belonging, and home.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Sãso. Alegría. Morada.</strong><br>
      A way of living.<br>
      A long-term promise.<br>
      And the beginning of a story meant to last for generations.
